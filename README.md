# AwesomeTube!

Ever wanted to use YouTube without having to deal with obnoxious comments and recommended videos that
distract you from already being distracted? Heck, even the likes and views counters aren't included.
Just the search bar, the video you're looking for, five similar results on the right side - that's it.

To use, run:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> npm install
> npm start
```

In addition, you will need a YouTube API key that you can plug in to the index.js file.

App made using React, very basic Bootstrap, and with awesome guidance by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider)
